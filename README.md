Brute force sudoku solver, renders a window in pygame to display the puzzle, searches for empty cells, and iterates. 
If any mistakes are detected the algorithm backtracks to the most recently altered cell and iterates again.
While brutish the algorithm solves puzzles relatively quickly, sluggishness stems from attempting to render every step.
